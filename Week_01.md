## Assessment

### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.

> **Learned a lot about the Git workflow**

> Understood the importance of pulling into main before pushing to the remote repo to make sure that any merge conflicts are happening on your local machine.

### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.

> **This week was not too strenuous in terms of learning outcomes.**

> A lot of the curriculum was frontend stuff which is where the majority of my experience lies. I would like to revisit the Asynchronous JS Execute Program module as, while I have previously learned Promises, I moved onto Async/Await and all my knowledge of Promises has gone. It has not been easy relearning Promises!!!

> **Going Forward, I would also like to work on different features in different branches**

> This is something that I neglected to do in this project and, while it didn't lead to catastrophe, it will someday!!!
